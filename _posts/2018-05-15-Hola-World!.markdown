## Hola Wolrd!

This is my first post, but sadly mainly a reminder to try and play the following linux windows managers:

* Flubox
* Openbox
* i3
* Awesome

I know all of the above are different, but i want to see which one would be o benefit to myself. Any suggestions? Perhaps i will post which one i end up choosing and why it wil help myself the best. 

Until next time,

MaskedFox
