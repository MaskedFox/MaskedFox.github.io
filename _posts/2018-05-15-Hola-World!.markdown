description: First post about some thoughts on Windows Manager
---


This is my first post, but sadly mainly a reminder to try and play the following linux windows managers:

1.Flubox
2.Openbox
3.i3
4.Awesome

I know all of the above are different, but i want to see which one would be o benefit to myself. Any suggestions? Perhaps i will post which one i end up choosing and why it wil help myself the best. 

Until next time,

MaskedFox
