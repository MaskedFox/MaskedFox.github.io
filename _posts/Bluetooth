bluetoothctl <--- It's an "app" to pair and connect bluetooth via CL

Other ways to connect via bluetooth:
  sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez bluez-tools rfkill

  sudo rfkill list
  
  sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
  
  sudo apt-get install blueman
  
Once you have paired with your bluetootth Headphones you need to choose the audio profile --> A2DP from the bluetooth options
and in the Audio Preferences you need to choose your Headphones as audio output.
